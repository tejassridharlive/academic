## TEACHING PORTFOLIO

My teaching philosophy emphasizes experiential learning through data-driven inquiry, connecting statistical and computational concepts to real-world business contexts. I encourage analytical reasoning, collaboration, and applied experimentation in every course. Analytical thinking in models, as I believe, is the core foundation to design experiments and advance scientific enquiry in any field.
